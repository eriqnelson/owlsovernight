    <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
  Owls Overnight has been proudly delivering Owls to customers throughout the
  Pacific Northwest since being founded in late 2015 by what is certainly Not
  Three Owls in a trenchcoat. From our humble origins in a tree by a stream that
  had a moderate amount of mice but mostly during the summer to our current
  <del>perch</del> office high above Portland where delivery drivers bring
  us mammals all the time we've remained committed to our mission; Owls. We've
  seen great growth over the years thanks to our loyal partners and we want to
  stretch our wings out beyond the forest and into the world.
    </p>
    <h2>What we believe in</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Anywhere without an Owl is probably overrun with vermin</li>
        <li>You can never have an Owl fast enough</li>
        <li>Silence, sharp claws and keen eyes are what is best in life</li>
        <li>Owls can solve most of your problems</li>
        <li>We deliver Owls</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Technology</h1>
  <p>
    We've developed several key technologies that allow us to deliver the Owls you
    want at the prices you need. As always our focus is on meeting your Owl needs and
    to that end we've focused our efforts in three key strategic areas we feel best
    help us achieve that goal.
  <ul>
    <li>Owl Standards</li>
    <li>Logistics</li>
    <li>Silence</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h3>Owl Standards</h3>
  <p>
    Since 2016 our CEO has served as Dread Claw for the Parliament Of Owls. In that
    role they provide wise counsel to the other members of the Silent Temple and
    guide the standards that shape the market today. As the industry leader in
    Owl Delivery and Owl Based Technologies we are honored to lead the
    industrial and regulatory conversation around Owls.
</p>
<p>
    We lead the field in basic research and our contributions
    to the Parliment Of Owls provide a solid framework for understanding the issues.
    Our core areas of inquiry are:
    <ul>
      <li>How much floof?</li>
      <li>Just how silent is silent?</li>
      <li>One claw or two claw?</li>
      <li>Head scritch: subjugation or delight?</li>
      <li>Night Vision</li>
    </ul>
    Published papers from our team are available online below
    <ul>
<li>Differentials in Owl-Level Productivity and Corporate Governance: Findings from White-Faced Scops (2015)</li>
<li>A Secure, IT-approved Alternative to Flinging Mammals Wildly With Your Beak(2015)</li>
<li>Improve Performance and Quality of Mammals for Eating with Sauces(2016)</li>

  <h3>Logistics</h3>
  <p>
    Getting Owls to our customers overnight requires that we constantly improve
    our logistics operations. We evaluate and invent new methods every day to achieve
    the speed that makes us the market leader in Owl Delivery.
  </p>
  <h4>Introducing Flamulate</h4>
  <p>Providing thousands of Owls overnight to our customers every day has given us
  unique challenges that we couldn't overcome with the solutions that we found in
  the market. Keeping track of that many Owls strained the off the shelf solutions
  that we deployed throughout our first year and we constantly asked ourselves
  "Hoo-hoohoooo?".
  </p>
  <p>
    We knew right away that the only way to answer that question was to build
    our own system. Right from the bottom up, creating the software we needed to
    grow our business while maintaining the level of Owls we'd staked our
    reputation on.
  </p>
  <h4>Features</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Scalable Database</li>
    <li>Actually Unique Unique IDs</li>
    <li>Functional and Extensible GUI</li>
    <li>Reporting that works</li>
    <li>Documented API for business logic integration</li>
    <li>Owl-Themed Class Names</li>
    <li>CLI that works well with "claw/beak style" keyboards</li>
  </ul>
